Nestled within the ancient city walls of Canterbury, Dane John
Gardens is a delightful blend of historical intrigue and tranquil
green spaces, making it a must-visit destination for anyone exploring
this historic city. From its Roman origins to its Victorian-era
redesign, the gardens offer a peaceful escape enriched with layers
of history.

## A Stroll through History

Originally a Roman cemetery, the area evolved over the centuries,
serving various roles before being transformed into the public
gardens seen today. The name 'Dane John' likely originates from a
corruption of "Donjon," linking it to its medieval past when it was
part of the city's fortifications. In the late 18th century, the
gardens were reimagined by landscape architect William Masters, who
crafted a space that combines scenic beauty with historical depth.
