The Saxon Cathedral at Canterbury and the Saxon Saints Buried Therein"
by Charles Cotton provides an in-depth exploration of the history and
significance of the Saxon Cathedral at Canterbury, as well as the lives
and legacies of the Saxon saints interred there. The book primarily
serves new members of archaeological societies and general readers
interested in the early ecclesiastical history of England. Cotton draws
on historical writings to piece together the narrative of the cathedral
from its origins around 602 AD under St. Augustine to its reformation in
the 16th century when it transitioned from a Benedictine priory to a
college of secular canons under Henry VIII. The Saxon period saw the
cathedral served by clergy who lived communally but did not adhere to a
monastic rule, a practice that was echoed during the Reformation.

Cotton's work highlights the archaeological and architectural evolution
of the cathedral, emphasizing contributions from key figures such as
Archbishop Lanfranc and St. Odo. Lanfranc, arriving in 1070, undertook
extensive rebuilding efforts after discovering the cathedral in ruins.
His reconstruction efforts, completed in seven years, laid the
foundation for the Gothic structure seen today. Cotton also pays tribute
to influential archaeologists and historians like Professor Willis and
Sir William St. John Hope, whose meticulous research and interpretations
have been instrumental in understanding the cathedral's history. The
book meticulously details the saints buried within the cathedral,
providing new material on their anniversaries and underscoring their
enduring spiritual and cultural impact .area of Durovernum (present-day
Canterbury) during Roman times.
