The arms of Sir James Hales of the Dungeon are blazoned as "Gu. three arrows or,
feathered and barbed ar." This heraldic description translates to a red shield
("Gu." for "gules") featuring three golden arrows ("or" for "gold"), with their
feathers and barbs in silver ("ar." for "argent"). The design is both visually
striking and symbolically rich. The red background traditionally signifies
warrior-like qualities such as military strength and magnanimity, while the
golden arrows denote readiness for battle and martial expertise. The silver
feathers and barbs highlight clarity and purity of intent. As a distinguished
member of the Hales family, Sir James' arms would have conveyed his noble
status, martial prowess, and readiness to defend his honor and estate. These
elements collectively underscore the values and reputation Sir James and his
lineage sought to project within the socio-political tapestry of their time.
