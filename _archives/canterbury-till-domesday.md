"Canterbury Till Domesday" by T. G. Godfrey-Faussett traces the
historical development of Canterbury from prehistoric times to the
Domesday Book. Initially, Canterbury's site emerged from a large tidal
estuary, gaining importance due to a strategically located ford that
connected major British and Roman roads. The town, known as Durovernum
during the Roman period, became an essential station because of its
geographical features, with its name derived from the Celtic "Dwr"
(water).

Following the Roman withdrawal and Saxon conquest, the site was
abandoned by Britons and later resettled by Saxons, evolving into the
city of Cantwarabyrig. The arrival of Augustine in the 7th century
brought Christianity, transforming the city’s landscape with the
establishment of the monastery of Christ Church on the site of
Ethelbert’s palace. Significant changes occurred post-Conquest,
including the extension of city walls, construction of a castle, and
Lanfranc’s rebuilding of the cathedral and monastery, marking
Canterbury’s transition into the medieval period and cementing its
prominence by the time of the Domesday Book.
