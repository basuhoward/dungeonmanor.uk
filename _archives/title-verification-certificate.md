This Title Verification Certificate marks a significant milestone
in the historical continuity of the Lordship of the Manor of Dungeon
in Kent. It confirms James Patrick Howard II's legal possession and
succession to the manorial title, emphasizing the deep-rooted
traditions and legal frameworks that continue to define the stewardship
of English historical titles and lands. This document serves not
only as a legal attestation but also as a reminder of the enduring
legacy of the manorial system in England, particularly within the
storied confines of Kent. The certificate underscores the role of
the Manorial Title Register and its authority in the lawful recognition
and registration of manorial titles, a process steeped in history
yet fully encompassed within modern legal practices.
